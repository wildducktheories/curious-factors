    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "A initial motivation for investigating this function is that integer solutions of this\n",
    "equation for $a=2$ correspond to the values of n for which n-sided, regular convex polygons\n",
    "tile the plane (without gaps). In particular, the values of $n$ for which $f(n,2)$ \n",
    "is an integer are $n = \\{3, 4, 6\\}$ and it so happens that these values also enumerate the set of\n",
    "n for which regular tessellations of the plane by convex n-sided polygons exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out not to be a coincidence, as will be demonstrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deeper motivation for exploring this equation is trying discover if there is a good reason why $cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ is rational only for the natural numbers $n \\in \\{3, 4, 6\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Niven's theorem proves that $cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ is rational only for natural numbers $n \\inc\\{3, 4, 6\\}$ but this proof relies on the rational root theorem and isn't obviously related to geometric consideations such as regular tessellations of the plane. Yet the coincidence of $n=\\{3, 4, 6\\}$ appearing in the regular tessellation case and the rational $cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ is remarkable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a more elegant way to demonstrate the rationality result which is somehow linked to geometric intuition? This document doesn't pretend to answer this later question, but perhaps we can illuminate the path towards it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tessellating the plane\n",
    "\n",
    "It is stated here, without proof, that an n-sided regular polygon can tesselate the plane if a polygon can be rotated\n",
    "an integer number of times about a vertex to produce an identically oriented and positioned polygon. The intuitive justification for this is that if you need a fractional number of rotations then any integer number of rotations\n",
    "will produce gaps (or overlaps) between adjacent polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the regular, convex polygon of n-sides. To produce a gapless rotation of one edge onto another, we need\n",
    "need to rotate the edge by the interior angle that separates one edge from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The centre angle that subtends the vertices at either end of an edge of a regular convex polygon of n-sides is $2\\pi/n$. The triangle so-formed with the edge is an isoceles triangle whose other angles are $(\\pi - 2\\pi/n)/2 = \\pi(1-2/n)/2 = \\pi(n-2)/2n$. The interior angle is twice that angle so $\\pi(n-2)/n$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the requirement that a polygon can be rotated k times around a vertex to produce an identical polygon\n",
    "can be reduced to the statement that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi(n-2)/n} = \\frac{2n}{n-2} = k$,  for some integer, $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is simply $f(n,2) = k$, for some integer $k$ which indicates the connection to the more general equation $f(n,a)$ that is the subject of this post.\n",

    "# Are $n={3,4,6}$ the only solutions for a=2?\n",
