    "This paper discusses a generalisation of a recurrence relation that I stumbled upon while exploring the question of why $\\cos(2\\pi\\frac{k}{n})$ is irrational except if $\\frac{n}{k} \\in \\{ 3,4,6 \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance of this recurrence relationship to that question is not explored further here, but because the recurrence relation itself is somewhat interesting, I have decided to present that recurrence relationship, followed by a proof of the formulate for the limit of convergence and a discussion of the result. \n",

    "For the purposes of exposition, call this limit $q_{\\infty}$. The limit depends on the parameters $a,b,c$ but\n",
    "does not depend on the initial value, $q_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A special case of this is when $a=b=2, c=1$ which reduces to $lim_{j\\rightarrow\\infty} q_{j} = q_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{6}.$ It was this particular instance that I noticed while pursuing the rationality of $\\cos(2\\pi\\frac{k}{n})$   question.\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting aspect of recurrence relations of this form is that by using them it is possible to \n",
    "map any rational number in ${\\mathbb{Q}}$ to an arbitrarily small ball of rational numbers \n",
    "surrounding any other number in ${\\mathbb{Q}}$ by successively applying the recurrence relation to its previous output until such time as that a sufficient degree of proximity is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given recurrence relation, there are an infinite number paths through the space of all rational numbers towards the limit of the recurrence relation. Each path has an infinite set of rational numbers which is disjoint from the set of rational numbers in all other sets, except to the set of numbers associated with the reverse path which is, of course, identical. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of convergence is determined by the parameter $b$ and the limit is determined by $\\frac{c}{a}$ divided by ${b+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Canonical Form\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical form of the recurrence relation can be obtained by replacing $a$ and $c$ with the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction $\\frac{c^\\prime}{a^\\prime}$ where $a^\\prime$ is constrained to be positive. This is equivalent of dividing top and bottom of an unsimplifed recurrence relation by $gcd(a,c)$.\n"
